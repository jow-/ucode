 * ucode/utpl syntax highlighting and ANSI source rendering, ported from the
 * pre-protocol interactive debugger (formerly lib/debug.c's
 * highlight_rules[]/compile_patterns()/print_source_location()) so it can
 * be reused by any client speaking the line-based debug protocol - or
 * anything else that wants to print ucode source with the same styling.
 *
 * This module is intentionally standalone: no ucode headers, no protocol
 * knowledge, just POSIX regex + stdio. A caller supplies already-split
 * source lines and, optionally, a single line/column range to shade as the
 * "current statement" - the multi-range/ellipsis-gap layout the original
 * server-side renderer supported for very large statements is not ported,
 * since every client of the debug protocol only ever receives one
 * contiguous range at a time (see SOURCE_RANGE in lib/debug_proto.h).
